![Me](/assets/img/face.jpg)

I'm a mechanical engineer/physicist who recently graduated from Portland State University.
I'm currently directing a project in the [Portland State Aerospace Society](http://psas.pdx.edu/) to build an [all-composite airframe](https://github.com/psas/lv3.0-airframe).
I wrote a paper on it, which you can find in the proceedings of AIAA SPACE 2016 titled [Design and Manufacture of an Open-Hardware University Rocket Airframe using Carbon Fiber](http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2016-5365).

My interests include mathematical physics, interdisciplinary engineering, and music composition. I'm currently taking a gap year before grad school.
