        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Joe Shields.</h1>
				<p>I'm a mechanical engineer/physicist who recently graduated from Portland State University.
				I'm currently directing a project in the <a href= "http://psas.pdx.edu/">Portland State Aerospace Society</a> to build an <a href="https://github.com/psas/lv3.0-airframe">all-composite airframe</a>.
				I wrote a paper on it, which you can find in the proceedings of AIAA SPACE 2016 (pending) titled Design and Manufacture of an Open-Hardware University Rocket Airframe using Carbon Fiber. </p>
				<p>My interests include mathematical physics, interdisciplinary engineering, and music composition. I'm currently taking a gap year before grad school.</p>
				<h3>AIAA SPACE attendees:</h3>
				<p>All of our sessions and presentations are over, but some of the posters will be up until 3pm on Wednesday. 
				Thanks to everyone who attended our sessions and presentations. 
				Don't forget to visit the <a href= "http://psas.pdx.edu/">PSAS website</a> and <a href= "https://github.com/psas">GitHub organization</a> to explore our projects. 
				Also, stop by <a href= "http://psas.pdx.edu/hangout">our weekly hangout</a>, every Tuesday at 7 pm (read: 7:30 pm) pacific time.
				</p><s>
				<p>I will be presenting a poster on the carbon fiber airframe from 7:30pm to 9pm in the grand ballroom. The title is Design and Manufacture of an Open-Hardware University Rocket Airframe using Carbon Fiber.</p>
