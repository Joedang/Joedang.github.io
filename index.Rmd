# Hi there, I'm Joe Shields.  <img src="../img/LV3.0_selfie.jpg" align="right" width="32%">

I'm a mechanical engineer/physicist who recently graduated from Portland State University.
I'm the mechanical lead for a number of small engineering groups in the Portland area.
These include: 
[Oregon's first satellite][oresat], OreSat; 
the [Portland State Aerospace Society][psas]'s [all-composite rocket airframe][lv3]; 
and [Pacific Diabetes Technologies][pdt].
I also volunteer for PSU's [Electronics Prototyping Lab][epl].

I'm searching for a full-time role where I can use and grow my professional skills.
I'm passionate about aerospace, interdisciplinary engineering, and open source technology.

I wrote a paper on it, which you can find in the proceedings of AIAA SPACE 2016 titled [Design and Manufacture of an Open-Hardware University Rocket Airframe using Carbon Fiber][lv3-paper].
