# Hi there, I'm Joe Shields.  <img src="../img/LV3.0_selfie.jpg" align="right" width="32%">

I'm a new manufacturing engineer at SpaceX, working on the mechanisms for Dragon 2. 

I got Bachelor's degrees in mechanical engineering and physics from Portland State University.
After that, I was the mechanical lead for a number of small engineering groups in the Portland area.
These include: 
[Oregon's first satellite][oresat], OreSat; 
the [Portland State Aerospace Society][psas]'s [all-composite rocket airframe][lv3]; 
and [Pacific Diabetes Technologies][pdt].
I also volunteered for PSU's [Electronics Prototyping Lab][epl].
I'm passionate about aerospace, interdisciplinary engineering, and open source technology.
