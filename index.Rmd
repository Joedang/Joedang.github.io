# Hi there, I'm Joe Shields.  <img src="../img/LV3.0_selfie.jpg" align="left" width="32%">

I'm an engineer with a broad skill set looking for work in the Pacific Northwest.

I just left a manufacturing engineer role at SpaceX, working on the [docking system][docker] for [Dragon 2][D2]. 
I was the mechanical lead for a number of small engineering groups in the Portland area.
These include: 
[Oregon's first satellite][oresat], 
the [Portland State Aerospace Society][psas]'s [all-composite rocket airframe][lv3],
and [Pacific Diabetes Technologies][pdt].
I also volunteered for PSU's [Electronics Prototyping Lab][epl].
I have Bachelor's degrees in mechanical engineering and physics from Portland State University.
I'm passionate about aerospace, interdisciplinary engineering, and open source technology.
