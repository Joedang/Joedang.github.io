# Hi there, I'm Joe Shields.  <img src="../img/2017_Endeavour_selfie_smaller.jpg" align="right">

I'm a mechanical engineer/physicist who recently graduated from Portland State University.
I'm currently directing projects in the [Portland State Aerospace Society][psas] to develop an [all-composite rocket airframe][lv3] and the [structure][oresat-structure] for [Oregon's first satellite][oresat].
I wrote a paper on it, which you can find in the proceedings of AIAA SPACE 2016 titled [Design and Manufacture of an Open-Hardware University Rocket Airframe using Carbon Fiber][lv3-paper].

My interests include mathematical physics, interdisciplinary engineering, composites manufacturing, and music composition. I'm currently taking a gap year before grad school.
