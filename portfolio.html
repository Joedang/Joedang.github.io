<p>A lot of my recent work has been proprietary. While most of it has
not been under an NDA, I feel it may be unethical to share certain
details.</p>
<p>My work obviously has an aerospace theme, but please don’t think of
me as an “aerospace engineer”. I’m really an artist pretending to be a
scientist pretending to be an engineer. I just like solving problems
which intersect many domains, and aerospace has a few of those
problems.</p>
<div id="megaharp-lots-of-fancy-polarimetric-cameras-in-space"
class="section level2">
<h2>MegaHARP: Lots of Fancy Polarimetric Cameras in Space</h2>
<p>This is the next evolution of the <a
href="https://esi.umbc.edu/harp2-project/">HARP</a> instruments. NASA
Goddard reached out to us to do a study on the cost, performance, and
many other parameters of a polarimeter for an upcoming orbital
observatory. The result of my work was a basline design that will likely
become the basis for their eventual request-for-proposals and <a
href="https://esi.umbc.edu/">ESI</a>’s corresponding proposal. It’s
essentially four copies of HARP, looking at different portions of the
spectrum with a narrower field of view.</p>
<p>I acted as a systems engineer, coordinating our engineering efforts
at ESI with the team at <a href="https://sdl.usu.edu/">SDL</a> working
on the electronics. I created a detailed week-by-week Gantt chart of the
funding, design, prototyping, building, testing, and delivery of this
6-year-long, 20-million-dollar project. I designed optomechanical
subsystems, including a radiometric self-calibration system, a filter
wheel, lens baffles, and sensor/prism holding. I worked with our
principal investigator, our thermal expert, and SDL to manage design
tradeoffs between our different subsystems, and to estimate performance.
Due to small changes in the requirements since the previous HARP, I got
involved in the optical optimization process. I worked with NASA systems
engineers to meet various checkpoints in the study and negotiate the
overall observatory design.</p>
<p>Initially, most of our estimates were based on some previous design
work. However late in the study, we found a serious problem. Due to an
oversight in some scaling laws, the mechanical layout of the system
drove our thermal system up in mass, to the point that we couldn’t meet
NASA’s rough initial requirements. Over the course of about three days,
I took advantage of my ability to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus">hyperfocus</a> and
redesigned the entire structure, thermal system, and internal layout.
This simplified the electronics and made the thermal system viable,
essentially saving the study and greatly improving ESI’s odds of
securing the eventual contract. Given the tight time constraints on this
redesign, I don’t think it would have been possible without
hyperfocus.</p>
<p>With the radiometric self-calibration system, I misunderstood the
design concept of a previous self-calibration system. So, when I
designed the new system, I accidentally used a different architecture
which ended up being more efficient than the previous design.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the autonomy I had with this project, and the
experience of managing design constraints among many subject experts. It
was a great opportunity to stretch my wings as a designer and just come
up with <em>anything</em> that might work. NASA provided a clear
schedule and set of requirements for the study, which avoided a lot of
potential anxiety for me.</p>
</div>
<div id="imap-inverse-multi-polarimetric-nephelometer"
class="section level2">
<h2>IMAP: Inverse Multi-Polarimetric Nephelometer</h2>
<p>This constituted the vast majority of my work at <a
href="https://www.airphoton.com/">AirPhoton</a>. By measuring the
intensity and polarization of scattered light at different angles and
colors, it measures aerosol and gas content as well as particle size and
material. The system was designed to operate outdoors continuously for
years.</p>
<p>I did the conceptual design and detailed design of the core optics
and setup the automation and firewall of the Linux system driving it. I
found a symmetry I could add (and another I could remove), which our
principal investigator had not realized, to the optical layout which cut
the overall size of the optics in half. In the subassembly which
collimates three coaxial laser beams of different wavelengths, I found
an arrangement of apertures which collimates the beams and catches the
diffracted light from each beam. Importantly, this new arrangement was
half the size of the previous design. I designed parts to hold and route
optical fibers throughout the instrument. I designed pneumatic seals
between all the parts of the core instrument. I also designed a simple
camera within the instrument.</p>
<p>I worked closely with another physicist, who did the benchtop
validation of the optics I designed. I also worked closely with another
mechanical engineer, who designed the enclosure, the mounting for the
supporting electrical and pneumatic equipment, and the mounting for the
core instrument. We had minimal supervision from our principal
investigator. We held check-ins every two weeks to make sure we were
following his vision for the system and to pry design constraints out of
him.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the team dynamic on this project. We worked
autonomously and had a clear understanding of our responsibilities and
system boundaries. Thanks to carefully planned interfaces and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_assembly">DFA</a>, when
we needed to integrate the system, all the mechanics Just Worked™.
However, poor communication of project expectations and dishonesty about
the schedule caused me a lot of anxiety and frustration. In combination
with the PI’s refusal to accommodate my mental health needs (via remote
work), this led to my resignation after the first few units shipped.</p>

<div id="airharp2-fancy-cameras-crammed-in-a-box-in-an-airplane"
class="section level2">
<h2>AirHARP2: Fancy Cameras Crammed in a Box in an Airplane</h2>
<p>This is a collection of custom and off-the-shelf instruments,
packaged into independent modules which can be flown on many aircraft.
It will initially be flown on NASA’s <a
href="https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/Gulfstream_V_-_JSC">Gulfsrteam
V</a> and <a
href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/aircraft/ER-2/index.html">ER-2</a>
in support of <a href="https://pace.gsfc.nasa.gov/">PACE</a>.</p>
<p>The instruments are a SWIR camera, a polarimeter similar to <a
href="https://esi.umbc.edu/harp2-project/">HARP</a>, an off-the-shelf
VNIR spectrometer, and a UV camera. I designed the SWIR camera, and the
majority of the structure.</p>
<p>The SWIR camera includes a lens assembly which is wide-angle on the
subject end and telecentric on the sensor end. It also includes a filter
wheel. The sensor is the same as what’s used in <a
href="https://www.oresat.org/">OreSat</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="itopie-3d-printer" class="section level2">
<h2>iTopie 3D Printer</h2>
<p>After graduating, I had unrestricted access to a laser cutter for
about two years. That got me hooked on rapid prototyping and design. I
really wanted some kind of CNC machine of my own, but I couldn’t afford
a laser cutter. So, I decided to build my own 3D printer.</p>
<p>The iTopie is an FDM printer I built following <a
href="https://reprap.org/wiki/ITopie">a reprap design</a>. The original
design used an MDF frame cut on a CNC router. I didn’t have access to a
CNC router. So, I modified the design to use thinner plates of laser-cut
MDF, which I laminated together.</p>
<p>I sourced the COTS parts from AliExpress, because I had a tight
budget. I sourced the printed parts from 3D Hubs and a local
makerspace.</p>
<p>I did the assembly during COVID lockdown, and encountered a lot of
design and fitment issues with the printed parts. I was able to fix
enough of the parts with epoxy and fiberglass to get it into a working
state. From there, I was able to redesign the problematic parts and
print new ones.</p>
<p>At this point, the entire hotend is custom. It’s not perfect, but
it’s good enough for my purposes and quite reliable.</p>
</div>
<div id="dragon-2-docking-system" class="section level2">
<h2>Dragon 2 Docking System</h2>
<p>I worked as a manufacturing engineer for the docking system of
SpaceX’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2">Dragon
2 capsule</a>. I mainly supported the In-Flight Abort (IFA) and Demo-2
units. Unfortunately, I can only show NASA-released pictures here, since
all my work was export-controlled and NDA-covered.</p>
<p>The IFA docking system was a mass simulator. It was built out of old
engineering-unit parts and purpose-built mass simulators. So, I adapted
manufacturing and testing work instructions from earlier units.</p>
<p>The Demo-2 unit had increased water-sealing requirements. So, I spent
a lot of time updating work instructions to include RTV sealing and
vacuum grease.</p>
<p>A responsibility common to both units was addressing issue tickets.
Frequently, out-of-tolerance parts would be received, mistakes would be
made during manufacturing, and engineering errors would be found. I
would work with design engineers, quality engineers, an technicians to
resolve these issues.</p>
<p>Most of the job boiled down to chasing down the “source of truth” for
information, tracking long lists of needed documentation changes, and
creating visual assembly instructions.</p>

<div id="artificial-pancreas" class="section level2">
<h2>Artificial Pancreas</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://www.pacificdt.com/">Pacific Diabetes
Technologies</a>, I worked on the mechanical design for a combined
continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump. I won’t be sharing images
of what I worked on, out of concern for the company.</p>
<p>I worked closely with an electrical engineer and chemist to spiral in
on the overall form of the device. Most of my time was spent designing
the non-disposable electronics enclosure, and the structure for the
disposable sensor/fluid-path. I prototyped designs using an <a
